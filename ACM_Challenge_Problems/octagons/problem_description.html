Below is a picture of an infinite hyperbolic tessellation of octagons.
If we think of this as a graph of vertices (of degree three), then
there exists an isomorphism of the graph which maps any vertex <i>x</i>
onto any other vertex <i>y</i>.  Every edge is given a label from the set
<i>{a,b,c}</i> in such a way that every vertex has all three types of
edges incident on it, and the labels alternate around each octagon.
Part of this labeling is illustrated in the diagram.

So a path in this graph (starting from any vertex) can be specified by
a sequence of edge labels. Your job is to write a program which, given
a squence of labels such as "abcbcbcabcaccabb", returns "closed" if
the path ends on the same vertex where it starts, and returns
"open" otherwise.


</p><h3>Input Specification</h3>
The input will begin with a number <i>Z</i> &#8804; 200 on a line by itself.  This is followed
by <i>Z</i> lines, each of which is a squence of length at least 1 and at most 40
of 'a's 'b's and 'c's.
<h3>Sample Input</h3>

<pre>2
abababab
abcbcbcbcba
</pre>

<h3>Output Specification</h3>
For each input instance, the output will be the words
"closed" or "open", each on a single line.

<h3>Output for Sample Input</h3>

<pre>closed
open
